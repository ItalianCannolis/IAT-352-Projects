<!-- first, you should extract the recipe info from the POST array -->

<!-- to extract all the 10 ingredients, you should definitely make a for loop! -->

<!-- take all the information and implode it into a single array with csv separators (usually commas) -->
<!-- I recommend you to concatenate all the ingredient information in a single string that will go into a single column.-->
<!-- you can use specific symbols as separators so you can explode the ingredient string later! -->
<!-- For example: 1#g#meat+++5#kg#sugar+++3#buckets#cyanide -->
<!-- so a full 3 column csv row would look like: "Grandma's Salad",1#g#meat+++5#kg#sugar+++3#buckets#cyanide,"Mix all ingredients and deep fry" -->
<!-- (BTW, never cook this recipe, the meat to sugar ratio is not appropriate... Oh, and also, cyanide is deadly.) -->

<!-- then, you should write the recipe row into the csv -->

<!-- finally, you should redirect the user to the d_list_recipes page -->
<!-- you can do this by creating a button so the user can click it when they want -->
<!-- or you can do it automatically after the recipe is added -->
